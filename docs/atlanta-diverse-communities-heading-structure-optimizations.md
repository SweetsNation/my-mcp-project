## Screen Reader Optimization

### Semantic Heading Structure

All headings use proper semantic HTML:
```tsx
<h1>...</h1>  // Not <div className="h1-style">
<h2>...</h2>  // Not <p className="h2-style">
<h3>...</h3>  // Not <span className="h3-style">
<h4>...</h4>  // Not <div className="h4-style">
<h5>...</h5>  // Not <p className="h5-style">
```

**Benefit:** Screen readers can accurately navigate heading hierarchy using:
- NVDA: H key
- JAWS: H key
- VoiceOver: VO+Command+H
