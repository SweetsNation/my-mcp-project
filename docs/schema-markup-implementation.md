  {
    question: 'Which Medicare Advantage plans in Atlanta offer multilingual support?',
    answer: 'Kaiser Permanente offers interpreter services in 15+ languages including Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean, and Chinese. Humana Gold Plus provides Spanish and Somali language support with focus on refugee communities. WellCare by Allwell offers dual-eligible (Medicare + Medicaid) plans with multilingual enrollment assistance. UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete provides the largest provider network with interpreter services at Grady Health System\'s Global Grady program (40+ languages).'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long do immigrants need to work in the US to qualify for Medicare?',
    answer: 'To qualify for premium-free Medicare Part A, you need 40 quarters (10 years) of U.S. work history where you paid Medicare taxes. If you\'re married, you may qualify based on your spouse\'s work record. Green card holders who have lived in the U.S. for 5+ years can buy into Medicare Part A ($505/month in 2025) if they don\'t have 40 quarters. Refugees and asylees can count work quarters earned after receiving refugee/asylee status.'
  },

    answer: 'Yes! Global Grady\'s refugee and immigrant health programs accept all Medicare Advantage plans that cover Grady Health System.

  },
  {
    question: 'Can undocumented immigrants get Medicare or Medicare Advantage?',
    answer: 'No. Medicare is only available to U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents (green card holders) who meet work history or age requirements. Undocumented immigrants do not qualify for Medicare or Medicare Advantage. However, community health centers in Atlanta (like Mercy Care Atlanta, Good Samaritan Health Center) provide healthcare services regardless of immigration status. For legal immigrants, DACA recipients, or those with pending immigration cases, consult an immigration attorney about healthcare options.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which Atlanta hospitals serve diverse immigrant and refugee communities with Medicare Advantage?',
    answer: 'Grady Health System\'s Global Grady program is the primary resource, offering culturally competent care in 40+ languages. Emory Midtown and Emory Decatur serve diverse communities with interpreter services. Piedmont Atlanta Hospital provides multilingual support for Hispanic, Asian, and African communities. WellStar Cobb Hospital serves the large Hispanic population in Cobb County. All these hospitals accept major Medicare Advantage plans (Kaiser, Humana, WellCare, UnitedHealthcare).'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do Medicare Advantage plans cover traditional medicine or cultural healthcare practices?',
    answer: 'Standard Medicare Advantage plans typically do not cover traditional medicine, acupuncture, or cultural healing practices unless medically necessary and provided by a licensed practitioner. However, some plans offer acupuncture for chronic lower back pain (covered by Original Medicare since 2020). Check with individual plans - some Kaiser Permanente and Humana plans include acupuncture, chiropractic care, or complementary medicine as supplemental benefits. Community health centers may offer culturally appropriate care alongside Medicare coverage.'

})
```

### FAQ Schema (6 Questions)
```typescript
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Which Medicare Advantage plan in Nashville offers the most transportation trips?',
    answer: 'Humana Gold Plus H5216-095 offers the most generous transportation benefit in Nashville with 96 one-way trips per year to medical appointments. This means you can take up to 8 round trips per month to doctor visits, specialists, or pharmacy pickups at no cost. The plan includes Vanderbilt University Medical Center and most Nashville hospitals in the network.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do Medicare Advantage transportation benefits cover rides to pharmacies and grocery stores?',
    answer: 'Most Nashville Medicare Advantage plans primarily cover transportation to medical appointments (doctor visits, specialists, lab work, physical therapy). However, WellCare by Allwell includes grocery and pharmacy delivery as a separate benefit - not rides, but home delivery of prescriptions and groceries. Some plans (like Cigna Preferred) may cover rides to pharmacy pickup if medically necessary. Transportation to non-medical locations like grocery stores is generally not covered unless combined with a medical appointment.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use Medicare Advantage transportation for wheelchair-accessible vehicles?',
    answer: 'Yes! All Nashville Medicare Advantage plans with transportation benefits are required to provide wheelchair-accessible vehicles under ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) requirements. When scheduling your ride, inform the transportation provider that you need a wheelchair-accessible vehicle. Common vehicle types include wheelchair vans with ramps or lifts. Plans covering wheelchair transport include Humana Gold Plus (96 trips), UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete (48 trips), and Aetna Medicare Eagle (60 trips).'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I schedule transportation with my Nashville Medicare Advantage plan?',
    answer: 'Step 1: Call the transportation number on your member ID card (typically 3-5 days before appointment). Step 2: Provide appointment date, time, location, and any special needs (wheelchair access). Step 3: Receive confirmation with pickup time (usually 30-60 minutes before appointment). Step 4: Driver arrives and transports you to appointment. Step 5: Schedule return trip or use on-demand pickup after appointment. Most plans require 24-48 hours notice, but some offer same-day transportation for urgent needs.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does Nashville WeGo public transportation work with Medicare Advantage?',
    answer: 'WeGo Access (Nashville\'s paratransit service) is separate from Medicare Advantage transportation benefits. WeGo Access costs $4.50 per one-way trip and requires pre-qualification for disabilities. Medicare Advantage transportation is free (covered by your plan) and doesn\'t require separate qualification. You can use both - WeGo Access for general mobility and Medicare Advantage transportation for medical appointments. If you have Humana with 96 trips/year, you may not need WeGo Access for medical trips, saving $4.50 per ride.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if I run out of transportation trips on my Medicare Advantage plan?',
    answer: 'If you exhaust your yearly trip allowance (e.g., 48 trips on UnitedHealthcare, 96 on Humana), you have several options: 1) Use WeGo Access paratransit ($4.50/trip, call 615-862-5950 to apply), 2) Contact senior centers (many offer volunteer rides), 3) Ask family/friends for rides, 4) Use ride-sharing services (Uber, Lyft - not covered by Medicare), 5) Consider switching plans during Annual Enrollment Period (Oct 15-Dec 7) to a plan with more trips. Some plans may provide additional trips for special circumstances - call member services.'
  }

    question: 'Which Medicare Advantage plans cover Grady Health System in Atlanta?',
    answer: 'UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete, Humana Gold Plus, WellCare by Allwell, and Aetna Medicare Eagle all include Grady Health System in their provider networks. UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete is specifically designed for dual-eligible (Medicare + Medicaid) members and offers $0 premium with comprehensive Grady coverage.

  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use Grady\'s emergency room with Medicare Advantage?',
    answer: 'Yes! All Medicare Advantage plans cover emergency care at Grady Memorial Hospital\'s ER, including the Level I Trauma Center. Emergency care is covered worldwide without prior authorization. You\'ll pay your plan\'s emergency room copay (typically $90-$120), which is waived if you\'re admitted to the hospital from the ER. Grady is Atlanta\'s only Level I Trauma Center, so for serious injuries or life-threatening emergencies, Grady ER is often the best choice.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does Global Grady accept Medicare Advantage for refugee and immigrant patients?',
    answer: 'Yes! Global Grady\'s refugee and immigrant health programs accept all Medicare Advantage plans that cover Grady Health System.

  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need a referral to see Grady specialists with Medicare Advantage?',
    answer: 'It depends on your plan type. HMO plans (UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete, WellCare, Aetna) typically require a referral from your Grady primary care physician to see a Grady specialist. However, Humana Gold Plus (depending on the specific plan) may allow direct access to specialists without a referral. Emergency care and urgent care never require referrals. Check your specific plan\'s rules by calling the number on your member ID card.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the copays for Grady services with Medicare Advantage?',
    answer: 'Copays vary by plan, but here are typical costs for Grady services: Primary care visit: $0-$10, Specialist visit: $0-$50, Emergency room: $90-$120 (waived if admitted), Hospital stay: $0-$350 per day (typically 5-7 day max), Outpatient surgery: $0-$300, Lab work: $0-$20. UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete members often pay $0 for most Grady services.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use Grady AND Emory/Piedmont hospitals with the same Medicare Advantage plan?',
    answer: 'Yes, with most plans! Humana Gold Plus and Aetna Medicare Eagle both include Grady, Emory, Piedmont, and Northside hospitals in their networks. This gives you flexibility to use Grady for primary care and emergency services while accessing Emory or Piedmont for specialty care if preferred. WellCare and UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete have more limited networks focused primarily on Grady and other safety-net providers.'

### FAQ Schema (6 Questions)
```typescript
const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Do IBM and Cisco retiree benefits work with Medicare Advantage?',
    answer: 'Yes! IBM Extend Health and Cisco Via Benefits programs are specifically designed to help retirees choose Medicare Advantage plans. IBM offers a Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) that reimburses Medicare premiums and out-of-pocket costs. Cisco provides a monthly subsidy toward Medicare Advantage premiums. Both programs coordinate as secondary coverage - Medicare Advantage pays first, then your employer benefit pays remaining costs. Many IBM/Cisco retirees choose UnitedHealthcare AARP Medicare Advantage (PPO) because it offers nationwide coverage for travel and out-of-network flexibility.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which Medicare Advantage plan is best for Duke University retirees?',
    answer: 'Humana Gold Plus H5216-140 (HMO) is the top choice for Duke University faculty/staff retirees because it has the strongest Duke Health network - including Duke University Hospital, Duke Regional Hospital, Duke Raleigh Hospital, and 50+ Duke primary care locations. The plan offers $0 monthly premium, $0 drug deductible, and $0 primary care copays. Duke\'s retiree benefits coordinate as secondary coverage, often resulting in $0 out-of-pocket for most services. UnitedHealthcare AARP (PPO) is an alternative if you want out-of-network flexibility or travel frequently.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use both Duke Health and UNC Health with the same Medicare Advantage plan?',
    answer: 'Yes, with certain plans. UnitedHealthcare AARP Medicare Advantage (PPO) includes both Duke Health and UNC Health in its network, allowing you to see doctors at Duke University Hospital, UNC Medical Center, and UNC Rex Hospital. Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina (HMO-POS) also covers both systems - primary network is WakeMed, but you can access Duke and UNC with a referral. HMO plans (Humana, WellCare) typically focus on one system (Duke OR UNC), so if you need both, choose a PPO or HMO-POS plan.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens to my employer drug coverage when I enroll in Medicare?',
    answer: 'When you turn 65 and enroll in Medicare, your employer prescription drug coverage ends and you must enroll in Medicare Part D (included in Medicare Advantage plans). If you don\'t enroll in Part D when first eligible, you face a 1% per month late enrollment penalty for life. However, if your employer plan is "creditable" (as good as Part D), you can delay without penalty - check with your HR. Most Research Triangle tech companies (IBM, Cisco, SAS) transition retirees to Part D at age 65, then use employer subsidies/HRAs to cover Part D copays and deductibles.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are Research Triangle Park tech workers eligible for Medicare at 65 even if still working?',
    answer: 'Yes! All U.S. citizens and permanent residents become eligible for Medicare at age 65, even if still working full-time at IBM, Cisco, SAS, or other RTP employers. However, if your employer has 20+ employees (all major RTP companies do), your employer health plan remains primary and Medicare becomes secondary. Many tech workers delay Medicare Part B until retirement to avoid paying premiums for secondary coverage. But you must enroll in Part A at 65 if you\'re receiving Social Security. Consult your HR benefits team about the best enrollment timing.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do Medicare Advantage plans cover specialty medications for complex health conditions?',
    answer: 'Yes! Medicare Advantage plans include Part D prescription drug coverage that covers specialty medications like Humira (autoimmune), Enbrel (rheumatoid arthritis), Revlimid (cancer), and other Tier 5 specialty drugs. However, specialty medications often require specialty pharmacy delivery and may have copays of $100-$500/month. Many tech employer retiree benefits (IBM HRA, Cisco subsidy) help cover these costs. Additionally, pharmaceutical patient assistance programs can reduce specialty drug copays to $0-$5/month. Check your plan\'s formulary before enrolling to ensure your medications are covered, and ask about Extra Help (Low-Income Subsidy) which can eliminate specialty drug costs entirely.'
