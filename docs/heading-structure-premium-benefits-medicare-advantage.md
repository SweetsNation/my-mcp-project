   - Keep H1 under 100 characters

2. **Logical H2 Sequence**
   - H2s should follow content flow
   - Use keywords naturally in H2s
   - Each H2 introduces a major topic

3. **H3 Subsections**
   - Use H3s to break down H2 topics
   - Include long-tail keywords in H3s
   - Make H3s scannable and descriptive

4. **Avoid Skipping Levels**
   - Never jump from H2 to H4
   - Maintain hierarchical structure
   - Use H3 before H4, etc.

5. **Keyword Placement**
   - Primary keyword in H1
   - Secondary keywords in H2s
   - Long-tail keywords in H3s
   - Natural language (avoid keyword stuffing)

### User Experience Guidelines

1. **Scannability**
   - Headings should summarize section content
   - Use descriptive, benefit-driven language
   - Include numbers when relevant ($3,000, 48 rides, etc.)

2. **Descriptive vs Generic**
   - ✅ Good: "Comprehensive Dental Coverage: Preventive, Basic & Major Services"
   - ❌ Bad: "Dental Benefits"

   - Avoid "click here" or vague language

2. **Logical Reading Order**
   - Content should flow naturally top to bottom
   - Headings should create document outline
   - Users should navigate by headings alone
