## Common Questions and Detailed Answers

### Income and Resource Questions

**Q: Do Social Security benefits count toward the income limit?**
A: Yes, Social Security retirement, disability, and survivor benefits all count toward the income limit. However, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) does not count.

**Q: I own my home. Does that count against the resource limit?**
A: No, your primary residence and the land it sits on do not count as resources, regardless of value. This includes mobile homes, condominiums, and cooperative apartments that serve as your primary residence.

**Q: What if I'm married but my spouse doesn't have Medicare?**
A: If you're married and living together, both spouses' income and resources are counted, even if only one spouse has Medicare. If you're married but living apart, only your individual income and resources count.

**Q: Do retirement account withdrawals count as income?**
A: Yes, distributions from IRAs, 401(k)s, and other retirement accounts count as income. However, the remaining balance in these accounts may or may not count as resources, depending on your access to the funds.

### Application and Benefits Questions

**Q: How long do Extra Help benefits last?**
A: Extra Help benefits continue as long as you remain eligible. Social Security reviews your eligibility annually based on updated income and resource information. You'll receive a notice if your benefits change.

**Q: What happens if my income changes after I'm approved?**
A: You should report significant changes in income or resources to Social Security. Changes may affect your benefit level (full vs. partial Extra Help) but won't necessarily eliminate your benefits entirely.

**Q: Can I apply for Extra Help if I already have a Part D plan?**
A: Yes, you can apply for Extra Help at any time, even if you're already enrolled in a Part D plan. If approved, your benefits will apply to your current plan or you can switch to a different plan.

**Q: What if I'm denied Extra Help?**
A: If you're denied, you can appeal the decision within 60 days. Many denials are due to missing documentation or misunderstanding about what counts as income or resources. You can reapply if your situation changes.

### Plan Selection Questions

**Q: Can I keep my current Part D plan with Extra Help?**
A: Yes, you can keep your current plan, and your Extra Help benefits will apply. However, you may want to compare plans since your out-of-pocket costs will be much lower, potentially making a different plan more cost-effective.

**Q: What if my medication isn't covered by any premium-free plans?**
A: You can choose a higher-premium plan that covers your medication. You'll pay the difference between the plan's premium and the Low Income Premium Subsidy Amount, but you'll still receive all other Extra Help benefits.

**Q: Do I need to choose a new plan every year?**
A: No, but it's smart to review your options during Open Enrollment. Plans can change their formularies, pharmacy networks, and costs each year. With Extra Help, you can also change plans any time during the year if needed.
