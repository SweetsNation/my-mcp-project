## 🏗️ Architecture & Implementation

### Component Structure
```
src/components/portal/
├── Dashboard.tsx              # Main dashboard with statistics
├── ClaimsManagement.tsx       # Claims handling and submission
├── DocumentManagement.tsx     # Document upload and management
├── PlanComparison.tsx         # Plan comparison tool
├── PortalNavigation.tsx       # Navigation sidebar
└── PortalLayout.tsx           # Layout wrapper
```

### Page Structure
```
src/app/portal/
├── dashboard/                 # Dashboard page
├── claims/                    # Claims management page
├── documents/                 # Document management page
├── plan-comparison/           # Plan comparison page
├── profile/                   # User profile page
└── settings/                  # Account settings page
```

### State Management
- **React Hooks**: Uses `useState` and `useEffect` for local component state
