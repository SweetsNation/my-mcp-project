              Medicare disability insurance provides healthcare coverage for individuals under age 65
              who receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits. After a 24-month
              waiting period from your first SSDI payment, you automatically become eligible for Medicare.

              To qualify for Medicare through disability, you must receive SSDI benefits from Social Security
              and complete the 24-month Medicare qualifying period. This waiting period begins with your
              first month of SSDI entitlement, not when you first applied for disability benefits.

              Prescription drug coverage is often critical for disabled Medicare beneficiaries who
